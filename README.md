Project I did for a school assignment. I made a very simple site with five pictures, a button and some text. When clicking the button the color of the website will 
change and some text will be revealed. I got the idea for the site when i saw street art of a little girl standing on top of a skull which reminded of the qoute:
"A generation which ignores history has no past-and no future". I included this on the brighter page but made my own qoute which made it easier to play 
with the idea of showing pictures of people from the older generations on the first page and then revealing the girl on the next page.
